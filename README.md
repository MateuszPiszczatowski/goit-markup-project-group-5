# GoIT students' project
This is a project of 10 GoIT students, made to pass the HTML+CSS part of the course. The task was to create a static website based on a design provided on Figma. The project is created with almost only HTML5 and CSS3, with a small exception for JS in case of modal and mobile menu functionalities.
